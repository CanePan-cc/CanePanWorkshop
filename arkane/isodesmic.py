This module provides the :class:`ErrorCancelingScheme` and related classes for the automatic generation of error
canceling reactions (e.g. isodesmic reactions). This code is heavily based on algorithms and ideas found in the existing
literature, including the following:

formation using error-cancelling balanced reactions. Combustion and Flame (Vol. 187).
